<h1>Framework Practice: Mini-Evaluation</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Practice applying the evaluation framework to a familiar tool before your major AI Tool Audit. This is your chance to try the framework, make mistakes, and learn—with no grade pressure.</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 45-60 minutes</p>
</div>

<div class="low-stakes">
    <h3>This Is Practice</h3>
    <p>This activity is designed to help you prepare for the AI Tool Audit (due next week). It's <strong>low-stakes</strong>—the goal is learning, not perfection. You'll get feedback that helps you succeed on the real assessment.</p>
    <p>Think of this like a scrimmage before the game.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why Practice Matters</h2>

<p>The evaluation framework has six components. Applying all six to a new tool can feel overwhelming. This practice session lets you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Try the framework on something familiar (lower cognitive load)</li>
    <li>Discover which components come naturally and which need work</li>
    <li>Get feedback before it counts toward your grade</li>
    <li>Build confidence for your AI Tool Audit</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Exercise</h2>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 1: Choose a Familiar Tool</h3>
    <p>Pick ONE of these AI-powered tools you already use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Search</strong> (yes, it uses AI for ranking and suggestions)</li>
        <li><strong>Spotify/Apple Music</strong> (recommendation algorithms)</li>
        <li><strong>Netflix/YouTube</strong> (recommendation systems)</li>
        <li><strong>Autocorrect/Predictive Text</strong> on your phone</li>
        <li><strong>Email spam filter</strong> (classification AI)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Choose something you use regularly—familiarity makes this easier.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 2: Apply Two Framework Components</h3>
    <p>For this practice, focus on just <strong>two components</strong>:</p>

    <div class="component-box">
        <h4>Function</h4>
        <p><strong>Core question:</strong> What does this tool actually do—and how well does it do it?</p>
        <p>Write 2-3 sentences addressing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What does it claim to do?</li>
            <li>Does it actually deliver? When does it work well?</li>
            <li>When does it struggle or fail?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="component-box">
        <h4>Failures</h4>
        <p><strong>Core question:</strong> How and when does this tool fail, and what are the consequences?</p>
        <p>Write 2-3 sentences addressing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What kinds of errors have you noticed?</li>
            <li>Can you tell when it's wrong?</li>
            <li>What happens when it fails—minor annoyance or real problem?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Example: Autocorrect</h3>

    <p><strong>Function:</strong> Autocorrect claims to fix typos and predict what I'm typing. It works well for common words and phrases—I type faster because of it. But it struggles with names, slang, technical terms, and anything not in its dictionary. It sometimes "corrects" things I typed correctly, which is the opposite of helpful.</p>

    <p><strong>Failures:</strong> Autocorrect fails most often with proper nouns (people's names become random words) and when I'm code-switching between languages. The consequences are usually minor embarrassment—a weird text message. But I've seen autocorrect cause real problems in professional emails where "regards" became something inappropriate. The tool gives no warning when it's about to make a bad correction.</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 3: Try Two More Components</h3>
    <p>Now stretch yourself with two components that require more research:</p>

    <div class="component-box">
        <h4>Data</h4>
        <p><strong>Core question:</strong> What data shaped this tool, and what data does it collect from you?</p>
        <p>Write 2-3 sentences. You may need to search or make educated inferences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What data was it likely trained on?</li>
            <li>What does it collect from your usage?</li>
            <li>Is any of this disclosed? What's hidden?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="component-box">
        <h4>Access</h4>
        <p><strong>Core question:</strong> Who can use this tool, and who is excluded?</p>
        <p>Write 2-3 sentences addressing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is it free? What do paid tiers add?</li>
            <li>What do you need to use it (device, internet, language)?</li>
            <li>Who might be excluded or disadvantaged?</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Reflection Questions</h2>

<p>After completing your mini-evaluation, reflect:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Which components felt easy? Which were harder?</li>
    <li>What information was difficult to find?</li>
    <li>How would your evaluation change if you had more time?</li>
    <li>What will you do differently on your AI Tool Audit?</li>
</ol>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h3>Key Insight: Framework as Habit</h3>
    <p>The goal isn't to memorize six categories. It's to develop a <em>habit of mind</em>—a set of questions that become automatic when you encounter any technology. After enough practice, you'll naturally think "What's it trained on? Where does it fail? What am I agreeing to?" without consulting a list.</p>
</div>

<h2>Preparing for the AI Tool Audit</h2>

<p>Next week, you'll apply <strong>all six components</strong> to a tool you've never used. Based on this practice:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>This Week (Practice)</th>
        <th>Next Week (Audit)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Familiar tool</td>
        <td>Unfamiliar tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4 components</td>
        <td>All 6 components</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>~300 words</td>
        <td>1500-2500 words</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Low-stakes practice</td>
        <td>25% of grade</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Peer feedback</td>
        <td>Instructor grading</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The components you didn't practice today (Terms, Broader Impact) will appear in the full audit. Review the <a href="../course-info/evaluation-framework.html">complete framework</a> before next week.</p>

<p>Submit a document containing:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Tool selected</strong> and why you chose it</li>
