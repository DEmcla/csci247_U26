<h2 id="academic-honesty-policy">Academic Honesty Policy</h2>

<p><strong>Policy link:</strong> <a href="https://lnk.mcla.edu/honesty">lnk.mcla.edu/honesty</a></p>

<p>A college is a community of students and faculty interested in the search for knowledge and understanding. Essential to that search is a commitment to honesty and integrity. Honesty on the part of every college student has and always shall be an integral part of the plan of higher education at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. Acts of dishonesty conflict with the work and purpose of the entire College and are not merely a private matter between student and instructor.</p>

<p><strong>Violations of academic honesty include but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting the work of others as one's own</li>
<li>Plagiarism (as defined below)</li>
<li>Communication during an examination</li>
<li>Using crib notes in an exam, except as allowed by the instructor</li>
<li>Obtaining prior knowledge of examination questions</li>
<li>Substitution of another student in an examination</li>
<li>Altering College academic records</li>
<li>Knowingly using false statements for academic benefit</li>
<li>Collaborating on material after being directed not to collaborate</li>
<li>Forging a signature of a College official or faculty member</li>
<li>Soliciting an official signature under false pretense</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> The academic departments of the College have varying requirements for reporting the use of sources, but certain fundamental principles for the acknowledgment of sources apply to all fields and levels of work. The use of source materials of any kind and the preparation of essays or laboratory reports must be fully and properly acknowledged. In papers or laboratory reports, students are expected to acknowledge any expression or idea that is not their own. Students submitting papers are implying that the form and content of the essays or reports, in whole and in part, represent their own work, except where clear and specific reference is made to other sources. Even if there is no conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgment may constitute plagiarism. Any quotation—even of a phrase—must be placed in quotation marks and the precise source stated in a note or in the text; any material that is paraphrased or summarized and any ideas that are borrowed must be specifically acknowledged. A thorough reordering or rearrangement of an author's text does not release the student from these responsibilities. All sources that have been consulted in the preparation of the essay or report should be listed in the bibliography.</p>

<p>Upon an occurrence of alleged academic dishonesty instructors may exercise their discretion in imposing a sanction. Instructors may further file charges with the Academic Appeals Committee against students if they believe that additional sanctions would be appropriate.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="ai-use-disclosure">AI Use Disclosure</h2>

<p>AI is simply a tool—nothing more. I use various AI tools, including Grammarly, Microsoft Editor, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to help refine years of classroom materials and textbook-based resources. These tools assist in reorganizing concepts, enhancing explanations, and transforming traditional course content into more engaging, practical lessons that align with modern industry practices.</p>

<p>Of course, AI can efficiently produce garbage if not properly guided. As humans, it is our responsibility to maintain oversight and quality control. It's an ongoing, iterative process, and I'm learning alongside these technologies.</p>

<p>I'm transparent about using AI as a collaboration tool to efficiently refine content and allow me to focus on critical thinking. I expect students to approach AI with the same intentionality; that is, students should use AI purposefully, and not as a shortcut.</p>

<h2 id="ai-policy">AI Policy for This Course</h2>

<p>This course is specifically about evaluating AI tools. You will be using AI extensively as part of course activities. When using AI assistance for assignments, you must clearly document your interactions and describe how the AI contributed to your work.</p>

<p>Your job is to <em>critically evaluate</em> AI output, not simply accept it. Submitting AI-generated content without your own analysis, evaluation, and reflection does not demonstrate learning and will be graded accordingly.</p>

<p>You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of any AI-generated content you include in your work. When in doubt about appropriate AI use for a specific assignment, ask in the Q&amp;A forum or email the instructor.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="media-recording-policy">Media Recording Policy</h2>

<p>A component of academic honesty is the distribution of materials and technology used in MCLA courses. Sharing materials (documents, video and audio files, online materials, etc.) without the written consent of the course instructor is a violation of academic honesty. Violations will be reported to the Registrar, and appropriate sanctions will be applied.</p>

<p>I ask that you review and agree to the following term of use:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I understand that my access to video and audio recordings in this class is for my personal educational use only. Class lectures, as presented, are the intellectual property of the instructor; comments made by other persons are their own intellectual property. I agree that I will not share or transfer recordings of such content by any method currently available or any method that may become available in the future. I agree that I will not provide copies of such recordings to others; upload, link, embed, or otherwise post them via file-sharing, social media, or other sites or services; enable anyone to view or hear them who is not currently enrolled in the course; or share them in any other way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="student-consent-recording">Statement on Student Consent for Being Recorded</h2>

<p>This class may use video or audio recordings of instructor and students, both online and in person, to better support student learning. Such recordings are for personal educational use only.</p>

<p>Recordings which include student names, voices, or likenesses are educational records protected under FERPA, and must be available only to individuals currently enrolled in the class, unless permission is expressly granted otherwise. Recordings of Microsoft Teams video meetings are automatically access-controlled to participants only when posted in Stream.</p>

<p>The instructor will always inform you when course activity is being recorded. By accepting this policy, you give your consent to be recorded in this class. You may withdraw your consent to be recorded by informing your instructor in writing.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="accommodations-statement">Accommodations Statement</h2>

<p>Students with disabilities who wish to access accommodations are advised to contact the Office of Disability Resources at 413-662-5314 or stop by the office in Mark Hopkins Hall room 102 to schedule an appointment. The Office of Disability Resources will work individually with students to determine accommodations that are reasonable for them. Based on the students' documentation, an accommodation plan is developed to facilitate equal access. It is the responsibility of the student to deliver and discuss their accommodation plan with their professor.</p>

<h2 id="tech-troubleshooting-policy">Tech Troubleshooting Policy</h2>

<p>If you encounter technical difficulties, here is the procedure I expect you to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the relevant <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/tkb-p/student">Canvas Guide</a> for an answer to your question. If this step doesn't resolve your issue, proceed to...</li>
<li>Email the <a href="mailto:helpdesk@mcla.edu">MCLA Help Desk</a> from your @mcla.edu address, and CC me. Providing a screenshot is often very helpful in diagnosing an issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>I may consider technical difficulties as a mitigating factor in late or missed assignments, but only if you can document that you have first followed these procedures.</p>

<h2 id="course-success-tips">Course Success Tips</h2>

<p><strong>To do well:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete pre-course setup</strong> — Don't start Week 1 without your accounts and portfolio ready</li>
<li><strong>Spread work across the week</strong> — Readings by Wednesday, activities by Friday, don't save everything for Sunday</li>
<li><strong>Plan for heavy weeks</strong> — Weeks 3, 5, and 6 have major assessments on top of regular work</li>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong> — Screenshots, prompts used, methodology notes—you'll need them for assessments</li>
<li><strong>Ask questions early</strong> — Use the Q&amp;A forum; your classmates probably have the same question</li>
<li><strong>Stay curious</strong> — The best learning happens when you genuinely want to understand how things work</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Waiting until Sunday</strong> — In an accelerated course, one missed week is devastating</li>
<li><strong>Not documenting methodology</strong> — You can't write about what you didn't record</li>
<li><strong>Accepting AI output uncritically</strong> — The whole point is to evaluate, not accept</li>
<li><strong>Skipping the Getting Started guide</strong> — Week 1 assumes you've already set everything up</li>
</ol>
<hr />
