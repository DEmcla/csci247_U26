<h1>Learning Portfolio</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p>Throughout the semester, you'll complete weekly activities that build your skills in evaluating technology. At the end of the semester, you'll curate your best work into a portfolio demonstrating what you've learned.</p>
    <p>This isn't about showing perfect work. It's about showing growth, judgment, and the ability to reflect honestly on your own thinking.</p>
</div>

<h2>What You Submit</h2>

<h3>1. Six Artifacts</h3>

<p>Select one piece of work demonstrating each of the six course learning outcomes:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Outcome</th>
        <th>Example Artifacts</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Explain how AI models work and select appropriate tools</td>
        <td>Model matching exercise, training data investigation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Apply the evaluation framework</td>
        <td>Framework application from any unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Communicate findings clearly</td>
        <td>Findings paper, methodology audit, critique</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Interpret and critique data visualizations</td>
        <td>Graph evaluation, benchmark analysis, "Make It Lie" exercise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Design and conduct controlled comparisons</td>
        <td>Reproducibility test, prompt sensitivity exercise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Evaluate source reliability</td>
        <td>Training data detective, any source evaluation work</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>You choose which artifacts best represent your abilities. You may revise work before including it.</p>

<h3>2. Outcome Reflections</h3>

<p>For each artifact, write 1-2 paragraphs addressing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why does this piece demonstrate the outcome?</li>
    <li>What would you improve if you did it again?</li>
    <li>What did you learn from the process?</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <p><strong>Be specific.</strong> "I learned a lot" says nothing. "I realized I was trusting AI-generated citations without checking them" says something.</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Synthesis Reflection</h3>

<p>One page addressing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How has your thinking about AI and technology evaluation changed?</li>
    <li>Which skill was hardest for you to develop? Why?</li>
    <li>If you encountered a completely new AI tool tomorrow, how would you approach evaluating it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It's Graded</h2>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Criterion</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>What I'm Looking For</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Artifacts</td>
        <td>40%</td>
        <td>All six outcomes represented; artifacts actually demonstrate the claimed outcome</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Outcome Reflections</td>
        <td>30%</td>
        <td>Honest self-assessment; specific observations, not generic praise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Synthesis</td>
        <td>30%</td>
        <td>Evidence of genuine growth; clear articulation of your evaluation approach</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>During the Semester</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Complete activities weekly; I'll spot-check for completion</li>
    <li>You'll get feedback on a few pieces to catch major issues early</li>
    <li>No detailed grading until you submit the portfolio</li>
    <li>Keep all your work organized—you'll need it at the end</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<div class="timeline">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weeks 1-12:</strong> Complete activities, keep copies</li>
        <li><strong>Week 13:</strong> Portfolio work session; bring questions</li>
        <li><strong>Week 14:</strong> Portfolio due</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>A Note on Revision</h2>

<p>You may revise any artifact before including it in your portfolio. That's the point—learning means improving. Just don't fabricate work you didn't do.</p>
